            Who we are
        </p>
        <p style="color:black">
            PeeknKeep is guided by four principles:
            customer obsession rather than competitor focus,
            passion for invention, commitment to operational
            excellence, and long-term thinking.
        </p>
        <p style="color:black">
            We employ extraordinary people who do meaningful work that
            has a tangible impact on the lives of individuals all over the world.
        </p>
        <p style="color:black">
            We focus on partnering with our sellers,
            not competing with them. We are building stronger
            connections between buyers and sellers with product experiences that are fast,
            mobile, and secure. And we are transforming the individual selling experience to
            help you turn the things you no longer need into cash you can use.
